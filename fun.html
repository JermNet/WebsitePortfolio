                As programming is what I hope to make as a career for myself, I have quite a few different personal projects. Now, website development is my favourite thing to do, so many of my projects are websites. It even feels weird calling them projects since I've done them all for fun, with the side effect of my skills improving.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course, I've done some non-website development projects in my time, but those are typically only when I get a really good idea. Or what I think is a good idea at least, haha. Either way, on this page I have a bunch of different things I've worked on so feel free to take a look at what strikes you.

            <p>
                This one takes a little bit of explaining. In the late 2000s/early 2010s, there was this fan-made application for the Nintendo DS called VNDS. It let you play visual novels (a type of story based game) on the aforementioned Nintendo DS. It's defunct now, but ever since I've found out about it, I've always had a real interest in it. Then, I eventually found the time to port a game to this platform!
            </p>
            <p>
                Milk Inside A Bag Of Milk Inside A Bag Of Milk is the visual novel I ported, and it took a little while but was a fun experience. I had to rewrite the script and code by hand, transferring it into VNDS's language (which is pretty primitive, it doesn't even have loops!). I also had to redo the images and sound as well, but not from scratch for those.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, it was a pretty fun experience since it was a personal project, but I also think it was a good experience work wise. I can imagine having to write programs from one language into another, so this was kind of an introductory experience to that.

            <p>
                One of my favourite things to do is to make websites on things I'm interested in, and this is a prime example. Clannad is a game and anime series, but that's not really important to explain here. What is important is that, along with being passionate about the topic of this website, I was passionate about making it as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                Originally, this was actually going to be one page on a much larger website. Aside from the main page and this, it had 7 other pages of equal to greater size to this. I was definitely over scoping with that. I think my new plan is to potentially make each their own website, and if I finish them all, make the changes needed to stitch them back together.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even with that, designing and making this page was really fun, and I've kind of adopted the drop down menu design for main articles as a personal design trope. It's here, after all, and I think it's a smart way to let the reader either browse through everything or just focus on one thing.

            <p>
                Although this was for a school project, I like to think of it as a personal project with a more strict time limit since I got to pick what I wanted to do. So, I decided to make a visual novel with Ren'Py, a language that uses Python but has specific language elements for making visual novels.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before this project, I had messed around with it, but never really made anything with serious intent to have something to show off or use. This was also my first introduction to using Python, even if it wasn't Python proper. So, it was a lot of learning for about a week of work, but it was pretty darn fun too. I got a nice end product out of it as well.
