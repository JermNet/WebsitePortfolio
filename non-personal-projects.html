                I've just recently graduated from NSCC, so that means I'm slowly building up a collection of new non-personal projects! Currently, this is a collection mostly comprised of my school projects since they're still fairly recent, but I will be adding as many things as I reasonably can from my different experiences in the workforce. I really hope you enjoy, because I'm really proud of what I have done!

                Now, programming isn't just about coding, there is the documentation aspect to it as well! It would be a bit boring if I went over everything individually, but here are a few different pieces of documentation I've done.
