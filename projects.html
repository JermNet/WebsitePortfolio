                The most important things when taking on a new job is learning what you'll do, fostering relationships and growing as a person and in your career. I hope to achieve all of those things. Actively working together with people is just something that can't be completely replicated through schooling, and is something I'd love to do with my potential coworkers. In school, the people all come from different backgrounds and have experiences, but they all learn the same thing for a reason. In a workplace, that's different. There will likely be people way above, and way below my level of knowledge. Both teaching and being taught are great ways to learn and to grow closer to people, so I'm looking forward to both.

                Just as an example, this is a video I've done explaining one of my assignments. I kind of went under the assumption that the person watching it would have knowledge of the topic at hand, but I still go over some of the basics quickly just in case. It's an example of me teach that I don't think is half bad, and I've tutored one of my classmates in the past, so I do think that I have the capability to teach others.

                This was our final project for our C course, a book management system. It was a challenge to do at first, but in the end it was simply putting concepts we already had together. There were some OOP aspects as we had to have a header file, as well as the book being a separate class from the main.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also had to dynamically allocate an array to accommodate a fluctuating amount of books, and save and load said books to and from dat files. It was an enjoyable challenge, and learning how to dynamically allocate arrays and to save to external files were important skills that I have since applied in other projects.

                This is a more recent project that we've done, meant to teach us the potential C++ has for object oriented code. It was pretty interesting and fun to see the differences between a C++ class compared to a Java class, and applying the concepts here went pretty smoothly. This one also forced me to learn how to dynamically allocate an array in C++, which is surprising different compared to C. Still though, this was a fun assignment to do, and I learned a good amount from doing it.

                This was my final project for Website Development, and the website on this scale we had to do. Due to having other projects during this time period, to give the required amount of time for each project, this one had to be done in about 3 days, and all 13 pages there are for it were required! Not only did this one teach me how to do more complex things with CSS, such as slideshows and layered navigation bars, but it also really taught me the valuable skill of time management. It was still fun to do, but I wasn't really thinking that as I was trying to get it done, I was just trying to make it nice with the time I had. I think that worked out, and although I think I've made better websites since (like this one!), this is a great one to show my learning.

                This assignment was actually kind of like 8 mini assignments in 1! We were tasked with doing 8 JavaScript related tasks, with the image being of one of them. This uses a weather API to get the data and print it onto a webpage. It was a really fun one to do, even if I misunderstood the 8th question and made a web app far before we were supposed to. I made it with XAMPP and an online SQL client, so it won't work as is, but I still think it's important to show off. Learning how to get data from APIs was really fun as well, as well as learning what JavaScript can really do for a webpage. If it weren't for this assignment, you wouldn't be able to open and close this section!

                This was a truly fun assignment. Our first assignment for this class was a light introduction to Beans as a concept, basically being POJOs plus Beans. This one, however, put us straight into the world of web application programming. It was Java, HTML, databases and Beans all rolled into one. It was certainly difficult since it was learning what new concepts come with making a web application vs. making a website, while also applying what I already knew in new ways. It reminded me that this is what I enjoy most, though. Even through still tying to understand what I didn't yet understand, it wasn't unenjoyable at any point along the journey.

                This is the schema for our final project for our Database Management class. The main goal of this one was to create a bunch of different commands, all of them you can see within the GitHub repo, as well as a detailed document of how I made this. It was a pretty fun one to do, even with having a time crunch. Though I think that applying the actual database aspects in other projects (like Mobile Development, for example) is a lot more fun and challenging than working with those aspects on their own. This was a great stepping stone though, and it would be much harder to apply those database aspects of other projects without learning them on their own.

                This was our final project for Object Oriented Programming. We were tasked with making something graphical, actually had a few options to pick from, with the "default" option being a quiz game. I decided to challenge myself by picking the calculator option. And it certainly was challenging! It was quite difficult getting everything working properly, and there were a lot of moving piece compared to doing something text-based, but it was worth it. I felt as though I was able to get a deeper understanding of Java through this project, and it's been a huge help in understanding Android development since there are a lot of carry overs. It was also nice getting some more practice with JavaDoc and documentation in general.

                This specific assignment may very well have been some of the most fun I've had doing an assignment. It was an advancement on a previous assignment, but we had to add intents. I ended up adding intents, of course, but I also added the ability to load images from an external website, which was a fun puzzle to figure out. 
            </p>

                This was also one of those assignments that felt like it could be something useful in the real world, as inanely useful as a Pokémon tracker app would be. I'm interested in Android development, so I might make this into a proper app at some point. But since I'm more interested in web development, that's something that's on the back burner right now.
