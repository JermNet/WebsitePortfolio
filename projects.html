                This section of my portfolio is for projects done for my classes! I've done a lot of different school projects, but there's only 11 here, 1 for each of the skills you'll have seen on the main page. All of my other programming related school projects are on my GitHub, but I just wanted to show off some of my favourites or more interesting ones. So, click a few "files" to hide away those extra windows and just focus on one project, or leave them all open and browse them all!

                This was our final project for our C course, a book management system. It was a challenge to do at first, but in the end it was simply putting concepts we already had together. There were some OOP aspects as we had to have a header file, as well as the book being a separate class from the main.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also had to dynamically allocate an array to accommodate a fluctuating amount of books, and save and load said books to and from dat files. It was an enjoyable challenge, and learning how to dynamically allocate arrays and to save to external files were important skills that I have since applied in other projects. Still, it was clear to me at this point that C wasn't my favourite language, even if this project had some fun aspects.

                For this final, we ended up having to make a student information system. I really liked figuring out how to properly manage a pointer to pointer array in C++. Thinking on it now, I probably should have used a Vector, but I suppose that would have been less challenging, so I think it's fine since I understand that. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I don't really mind C++, but it's similar enough to C that they're in the same tier for me. I prefer Java and C# over both by a mile, but I still have the skills to do C++ if I need to. I would just probably won't do any personal projects with C or C++.

                This was my final project for Website Development, and the first website on this scale we had to do. Due to having other projects during this time period, to give the required amount of time for each project, this one had to be done in about 3 days, and all 13 web pages I made for it were required! Not only did this one teach me how to do more complex things with CSS, such as slideshows and layered navigation bars, but it also really taught me the valuable skill of time management. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Even with the aforementioned time crunch, this specific website really helped me realize that I wanted to do web development. I still wasn't fully set by the time I finished this, but if I didn't have this stepping stone, it probably would have taken me a good bit longer to find out.

                This assignment was actually kind of like 8 mini assignments in 1! We were tasked with doing 8 JavaScript related tasks, with the image being of one of them. This uses a weather API to get the data and print it onto a webpage. It was a really fun one to do, even if I misunderstood the 8th question and made a web app far before we were supposed to. I made it with XAMPP and an online SQL client, so it won't work as is, but I still think it's important to show off. Learning how to get data from APIs was really fun as well, as well as learning what JavaScript can really do for a webpage. If it weren't for this assignment, you wouldn't be able to open and close this section!

                As a lover of web development and web design, this was a really fun assignment to do. We just had to make a website, making sure to use heavy CSS. Another on of the requirements was to make the website responsive. As a result, I decided to go heavy on the icon groups and top bar turning into a hamburger menu.
            </p>
            <p>
                As you can probably tell, I had a lot of fun making the website, and even applying the responsiveness. I have done a lot of the things on this website better since I've originally made it, namely groups of icons, and responsiveness as a whole. But I am proud of the website as a whole, even if I would have done things differently now, either from a design or programming perspective.

                This is the schema for our final project for our Database Management class. The main goal of this one was to create a bunch of different commands, all of them you can see within the GitHub repo, as well as a detailed document of how I made this. It was a pretty fun one to do, even with having a time crunch. Though I think that applying the actual database aspects in other projects (like Mobile Development, for example) is a lot more fun and challenging than working with those aspects on their own. This was a great stepping stone though, and it would be much harder to apply those database aspects of other projects without learning them on their own.

                This was our final project for Object Oriented Programming. We were tasked with making something graphical, actually had a few options to pick from, with the "default" option being a quiz game. I decided to challenge myself by picking the calculator option. And it certainly was challenging! It was quite difficult getting everything working properly, and there were a lot of moving piece compared to doing something text-based, but it was worth it. I felt as though I was able to get a deeper understanding of Java through this project, and it's been a huge help in understanding Android development since there are a lot of carry overs. It was also nice getting some more practice with JavaDoc and documentation in general.

                This specific assignment may very well have been some of the most fun I've had doing an assignment. It was an advancement on a previous assignment, but we had to add intents. I ended up adding intents, of course, but I also added the ability to load images from an external website, which was a fun puzzle to figure out. 
            </p>

                This was also one of those assignments that felt like it could be something useful in the real world, as inanely useful as a Pokémon tracker app would be. I'm interested in Android development, so I might make this into a proper app at some point. But since I'm more interested in web development, that's something that's on the back burner right now.
