                One of my pre-programming era websites (as a result, it's not the greatest).

                As programming is what I hope to make as a career for myself, I have quite a few different personal projects. Now, website development is my favourite thing to do, so many of my projects are websites. It even feels weird calling them projects since I've done them all for fun, with the side effect of my skills improving.

            <p>
                Of course, I've done some non-website development projects in my time, but those are typically only when I get a really good idea. Or what I think is a good idea at least, haha. Either way, on this page I have a bunch of different things I've worked on so feel free to take a look at what strikes you.
